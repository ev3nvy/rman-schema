# rman-schema

This is a [FlatBuffer][flatbuffers] schema for the [.manifest][manifest] format made by
[RiotGames][riot-games].

## Status

Currently, the code, generated by the schema, is able to parse the data of `.manifest` files
successfully, however, some variables and their types are still unknown. Those variables are
named `unkX` and have all of the possible types listed in the inline comments.

## Building

To build the provided schema you will need `flatc`. You can build `flatc` yourself (see
[building][flatbuffers-guide-building]), or use one of the prebuilt binaries (see
[releases][flatbuffers-releases]).

Once you have `flatc` installed, you can build it for the language of you choice (see
[using the compiler][flatbuffers-guide-using-schema-compiler]).

## Contributing

If you find a bug with the schema, or you find the usage for the remaining unknown variables,
please open up an issue or make a PR.
