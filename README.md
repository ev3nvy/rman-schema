This is a [FlatBuffer][flatbuffers] schema for the [.manifest][manifest] format made by
[RiotGames][riot-games].

## Status

Currently, the code, generated by the schema, is able to parse the data of `.manifest` files
successfully, however, some variables and their types are still unknown. Those variables are
named `unkX` and have all of the possible types listed in the inline comments.

## Building

To build the provided schema you will need `flatc`. You can build `flatc` yourself (see
[building][flatbuffers-guide-building]), or use one of the prebuilt binaries (see
[releases][flatbuffers-releases]).

Once you have `flatc` installed, you can build it for the language of you choice (see
[using the compiler][flatbuffers-guide-using-schema-compiler]).

Alternatively, you can download the compiled schema, for your
[desired language][flatbuffers-languages], from [releases page][repository-releases].

## Contributing

If you find a bug with the schema, or you find the usage for the remaining unknown variables,
please open up an issue or make a PR.

## Seeking help

If you need any help, or have any questions, feel free to open an issue, or ask for assistance
[on discord][discord].

## Acknowledgements

- @moonshadow565 for the amazing work over at
[rman - set of CLI tools for rito manifest and bundle files][moonshadow565-rman]. Most of the
schema is based upon his work.
- @Morilli for creating [ManifestDownloader][morilli-manifest-downloader], which was my first
exposure to the inner workings of `.manifest` format, and for answering my question on discord.
